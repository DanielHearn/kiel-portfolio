  An artist and storyteller, passionate about narrative products, including
  video games, tabletop games and film. 


  Check out my science fiction novels on Amazon, which reflect on the nature of life and choice through the exploration of a far-future society. 


  As an artist, I am experienced with character, vehicle, prop and environment concept design. Capable of producing orthographic views and turnarounds, design pages and full illustrations. I am open to working on moving image, interactive media or print projects.
